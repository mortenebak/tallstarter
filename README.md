This Starter kit contains my starting point when developing a new Laravel project. Its based on the official Livewire Starter kit, and includes the following features:
- ✅ **User Management**, 
- ✅ **Role Management**,
- ✅ **Permissions Management**,
- ✅ **Localization** options
- ✅ Separate **Dashboard for Super Admins**
- ✅ Updated for Laravel 12.0 **and** Livewire 3.0

## TALL stack
It uses the TALL stack, which stands for:
-   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
-   [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev)
-   [Laravel](https://laravel.com)
-   [Laravel Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com) using the components.

## Further it includes:
Among other things, it also includes:
-   [Flux UI](https://fluxui.dev) for flexible UI components (free version)
-   [Laravel Pint](https://github.com/laravel/pint) for code style fixes
-   [PestPHP](https://pestphp.com) for testing
-   [missing-livewire-assertions](https://github.com/christophrumpel/missing-livewire-assertions) for extra testing of Livewire components by [Christoph Rumpel](https://github.com/christophrumpel)

## Upcoming features
I'm considering adding the following features, depending on my clients' most common requirements:
-   [Wire Elements / Modals](https://github.com/wire-elements/modal) for modals (still deciding - for now I'm using Flux UI for this)
-   [Laravel Cashier](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/billing) for Stripe integration
